I have given three sides to this application...<br>
So first there are some endpoints that are permitted to all. These are as follows:<br>
  1 -> LogIn endpoint (end points=>'http://localhost:8080/logIn')<br>
	2 -> Host Sign Up (end point=>'http://localhost:8080/add/hosts') {For Host and Admin email will be generated by the application backend, don't provide it even after providing the application will change it according to written logic.}<br>
	3 -> User Sign Up (end point=>'http://localhost:8080/add/users')<br>

<p align="center">
	<h3>For all the Show/See requests(Method="GET"), you can get it in pages and can order it(Default->by name/id). For pagination and sorting in Get method endpoints, you have to add the things which are as follows...</h3>
	<h4 align="center"> ?page={yourPageNumber}&count={ourItemCount}&order={desc/asc}</h4>
</p>
<!-- <br>
For running these given endpoints you can visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html">here</a> after running application in your local system.<br>
<br> -->
To access these endpoints you have to clone the repo into your system and have to have java17 installed then you can access these endpoints in Postman.<br>
These were some functionality of my application.
<br>
Thank you.....
